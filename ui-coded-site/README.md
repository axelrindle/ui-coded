## Note on the GitHub API
The GitHub API has a rate limit, which is set **60 per hour** for unanthenticated users.
In order to increase this limit to **5000 per hour**, you have to authenticate yourself.
To use authentication, you can append `/?token=AUTH_TOKEN` to the url where `AUTH_TOKEN`
is your **personal access token**.
